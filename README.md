# Frontend (Vercel Ready CRA)

This React app is built with Create React App and is pre-configured to deploy on **Vercel** with a backend hosted on **Render**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the production bundle inside `build/`. The output is what Vercel serves.

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Add `.env.production` (not committed) with:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-render-api.onrender.com
   ```
2. Push the `frontend` folder to GitHub.
3. Import the repo in Vercel → Framework preset **Create React App**
4. Root directory: `frontend`
5. Build command: `npm run build`
6. Output directory: `build`
7. Set the same `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel.

After every push, Vercel will rebuild automatically.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
